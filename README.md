# DSA - Data Structures & Algorithms

This repository aims to demonstrate how low the lower bound of one's data structure and algorithmic ability can be.

## File Structure

Usually, the file will be named as `A.java` and `ATest.java`. `ATest.java` will be the test file to `A.java`.

Consider the extremely low ability I have, I cannot use Unit Test in Java. Maybe in some day, I will convert it to.
